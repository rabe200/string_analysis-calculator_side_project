README

before implementing into main project
i here do some experiments and test them without any gui
goal is to analyse a complete string:
find numbers and put them as string into array
find mathematical operators and trigger calculation

as i am still just a trainee, this is quite a challenge for me.
i try to use what i have learned at neueFisch bootcamp
but there is still a lot of research needed
this is a private project

i think it is a very useful practise
i plan to develop different kind of calculators
so this is the preBeta-sidecode for my first calculator
