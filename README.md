<p>before implementing into main project<br>
i here do some experiments and test them without any gui<br>
goal is to analyse a complete string:<br>
find numbers and put them as string into array<br>
find mathematical operators and trigger calculation<br>

<p>as i am still just a trainee, this is quite a challenge for me. <br>
i try to use what i have learned at neueFisch bootcamp <br>
but there is still a lot of research needed<br>
this is a private project<br>

<p>i think it is a very useful practise<br>
i plan to develop different kind of calculators<br>
so this is the preBeta-sidecode for my first calculator<br>
